Question) 
         Hibernate CRUDQ Operations.
Perform the following steps.
1) SetUp Hibernate Project (add dependencies hibernate and mysqlConnector)
2) Configure hibernate.cfg.xml file
3) Create Teacher Pojo class with the following fields
    a) id 
    b) f_Name
    c) l_Name
    d) email
4) Perform Insert, Update, Read, Query, and Delete operations, using SessionFactory and session objects.

One to one Bidirectional
Write the code for the following operations in the database using hibernate ORM with java.
Students have a specific address, we are required to store the student and their address and may remove the same.
1.	Create a Student table and an Address table with the proper Bidirectional one to one association.
2.	Fetch the student details with the help of given address
3.	Remove an Address Record from the database along with the cascaded effect on Students.


=> here it's similar to unidirectional, only difference is that in the address class you need to create a new Student object
and have to add the annotation @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, mappedBy="address")

also maybe inorder to remove the persistance exception, have to remove the getter and setter for the primary ids.

One to one UNIdirectional

Write the code for the following operations in the database using hibernate ORM with java.
Students have a specific address, we are required to store the student and their address and may remove the same.
1.	Create a Student table and an Address table with one to one unidirectional association.
2.	Insert data into Student along with the required Address.
3.	Remove a Student from the database with the cascade effect on Address table.


=> Simply create the Student class, there create the object of Address and do the one to one mapping with the cascading effect
=> Create the Address class there we don't need to mention anything for one to one as cascading will take care of everything, 
insert and delete operation will happen automatically.

One to MANY Bidirectional

Write the code for the following operations in the database using hibernate ORM with java.
A Student can enroll in different and more than one courses, so we are required to store the student and course 
details in the database and may remove the same based on the need.
1.	Create a Student table and a course table with the proper Bidirectional one to many associations.
2.	Insert data into Student along with data in the courses.
3.	Remove a Course from the database without affecting students.


==> Here in order to perform one to many, we need to first of all use the cascade so that while performing deletetion/insertion
all child entries of parent(PK) will be added or deleted in other child table.

@OneToMany(fetch=FetchType.EAGER,cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)
@JoinColumn(name = "student_id")
List<Course4> courses;

@ManyToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "student_id")	
private Student4 student;

MANY to MANY 

Write the code for the following operations in the database using hibernate ORM with java.
An Employee can be assigned to more than one project and the same is true for a project as a project can also 
be assigned to more than one employee.

1.	Create an Employee table and a project table with the Bidirectional many to many associations.
2.	Insert data into the Employee along with the details of the project assigned to that employee.
3.	Fetch all employee names for a given project Id and vice versa for an employee.
